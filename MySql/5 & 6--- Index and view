/*
My SQL Index-----  
Exp- In our notebook we use the index page to check the data in book
Similarly we use the idex in mysql also

CREATE INDEX  statment in sql is used to create indexes in tables.
==> Spead up the process of retreiving the data from table
==> Degrade the speed of insert/update as now we need to update index also.

/*
View------
View is a VIRTUAL TABLE based on the result of an any query.

ADVANTAGE 1: let's say we have 1 student table(id primary key, and some other column) and 
1 Department table(id(foreign key), and other columns) so we want the details from both table on behalf of id.
Here we will perform the Inner Join and get the data, and this query we can assign as view
so that whenever you call this name this inner join query willl be executed automatically.


Advantage 2: You have 20 tables in your database and one junior person comes to you ans ask to share data but there is some 
important that you don't want to share and even junior also require data from only 2 tables.
so you can fetch the data and assign that as view and share the name of view.


Qus: Can we use view forany knid of query?
No, Complex query can not use as view. like agg func, groupby, having, update, insert, union, left outer join, 
outer join  not work in view
