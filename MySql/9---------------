1) Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

select distinct(CITY) from STATION where left(CITY,1) not in ('a','e','i','o','u') or right(CITY, 1) not in ('a','e','i','o','u');




2) Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than  Marks. Order your output by the last three characters of each name.

select Name from STUDENTS where Marks>75 order by right(Name,3) asc, id asc;




3) print all name by order:

select Name from Employee order by Name;


# To check Null Values

Select first_name, last_name from employee where address is null




#--------------------Group By

The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.


GROUP BY Syntax

select column_name from table_name where condition group_by column_name order_by column_name

#SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country:
select count(CustomerName), Country from employee group by Country order by Country
